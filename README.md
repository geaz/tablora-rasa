# Tablora Rasa - A table-less, tarot based TTRPG oracle

Tablora Rasa is a table-less, tarot-based, and TTRPG system agnostic oracle. With enough creativity and the following rules, this oracle can answer any question during an adventure in your TTRPG sessions.

- yes/no questions (50/50, Likely, Unlikely)
- open questions
- generating random events
- generating NPCs
- generating Locations

**Youâ€™re only limited by your imagination!**

With a little practice, or for those who already know how to interpret tarot cards, the complete oracle works without tables! To get you started, this guide contains a small introduction to tarot cards.

**The functionality of this oracle is strongly dependent on your creativity and interpretation. It is, in no way, a predetermined narrative oracle.**

But if you go for it, you will be rewarded with an oracle with endless possibilities for which no books with tables have to be rolled!
